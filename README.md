# How_To_Use_Our_Repositories

Try downloading a file. You can't open it and use it right away, right?
Well here are a few ways to use our repositories yourself.

1. Forking. This creates a personal copy of our repository for yourselves. 
Though, it would be nice if you didn't forget where you got the copy from if you share it somewhere.

2. Copy and Paste. You can copy paste our code! This is much more convenient if you don't own a github account.
But what AFTER you copy paste? Well, there are PLENTY of online IDE's that YOU can use to try out our code.
But, what IDE? Well there are a LOT. But you probably want a ONLINE IDE rather than one you download.
Well, for that case you can use ONLINEGBD. Enter that on your web browser and it should appear. Enter and select language.
then choose python 3. refresh the page and BOOM! Now all you got to do is paste our code in, hit run, and VOILA!
Now you have run our code without needing to have an account!

There you go. Two methods of running our code! one is easy but you need an account, the other is a bit complex but don't need an account.

Now, ENJOY!
